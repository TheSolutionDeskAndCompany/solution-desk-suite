Let’s wire up **FlowMatic** end‑to‑end and make sure your purple & rose‑gold theme actually loads. Follow these steps in your Repl:

---

## 1. Rename your tool in Replit DB

Open the **Database** sidebar, delete your old `tool:workflow_visualizer` entry, then add:

```python
# In the DB console (or run this once in a scratch cell)
from replit import db

db["tool:flowmatic"] = {
  "id":       "flowmatic",
  "name":     "FlowMatic",
  "problem":  "Scattered process steps slow you down",
  "solution": "Auto‑generate interactive flowcharts from plain text",
  "route":    "flowmatic.index"
}
```

---

## 2. Register your FlowMatic blueprint

Rename your blueprint file to `flowmatic.py` (if you haven’t already) and inside:

```python
# flowmatic.py
from flask import Blueprint, render_template, request

flowmatic_bp = Blueprint("flowmatic", __name__, template_folder="templates")

@flowmatic_bp.route("/", methods=["GET","POST"])
def index():
    if request.method=="POST":
       # handle the POST that generates your diagram…
       pass
    return render_template("flowmatic.html")
```

Then in `app.py` swap:

```diff
- from workflow_visualizer import workflow_visualizer_bp
- app.register_blueprint(workflow_visualizer_bp, url_prefix="/workflow-visualizer")
+ from flowmatic import flowmatic_bp
+ app.register_blueprint(flowmatic_bp, url_prefix="/flowmatic")
```

## 3. Update your homepage template

In `templates/index.html`, change the flagship card to use **FlowMatic** and match your CSS selector `.flagship-card`:

```html
<div class="card flagship-card">
  <h3>{{ flagship.name }}</h3>
  <p><strong>Problem:</strong> {{ flagship.problem }}</p>
  <p><strong>Solution:</strong> {{ flagship.solution }}</p>
  <a class="btn-highlight" href="{{ url_for(flagship.route) }}">
    Generate FlowMatic
  </a>
</div>
```

Make sure you’ve swapped any remaining `{{ url_for("workflow_visualizer.index") }}` to `{{ url_for("flowmatic.index") }}`.

---

## 4. Verify your FlowMatic page

Rename `templates/workflow_visualizer.html` → `templates/flowmatic.html` and at the top:

```html
<h1>⚡ FlowMatic</h1>
<p class="tagline">
  Turn your text‐based process steps into clean, interactive flowcharts instantly.
</p>
<form method="POST">
  <textarea name="process" placeholder="
    e.g. Customer places order → Payment is processed → Inventory checked → Shipping label created → Confirmation email sent
  "></textarea>
  <button class="btn-highlight" type="submit">
    Generate FlowMatic
  </button>
</form>
```

---

## 5. Ensure your CSS is loading

1. In your `<head>` (e.g. `templates/base.html` or at top of `index.html`), confirm:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='css/style.css') }}">
   ```

2. In `static/css/style.css`, verify the block you pasted (the `:root { … }` purple & rose‑gold variables) appears **before** any other overrides.

3. Hard‑refresh your browser (Ctrl + F5) to bust the cache.

---

## 6. Run & test

* Click **Run** in Replit
* Visit `https://<your‑repl>.replit.dev/` — you should see one full‑width **FlowMatic** card, styled in your purple & rose‑gold theme.
* Clicking “Generate FlowMatic” should take you to `…/flowmatic` and render your tool page in the same colors.

Once you’ve gone through all six steps, your flagship will **pop**, the name will stick, and your cyberpunk‑refined purple & rose‑gold will actually show up. Let me know if you hit any snags!
